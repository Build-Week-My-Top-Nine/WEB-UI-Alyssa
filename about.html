          <p>
            I'm currently enrolled in Lambda School to accelerate my learning to
            become a Full Stack Web Developer. When I'm not coding and trying to
            grasp new ideas and languages, I like to play music. Typically I jam
            on the guitar but I'll sometimes go on the keys and play a couple
            chords there but the guitar definitely has my heart. I look forward
            to implementing new concepts and technologies that I learn.

            <p>
              I am a student from Southeast Texas. Lambda School is my first
              taste of working with code and I am enjoying my learning
              experience so far. In my down time I like to play video games with
              my friends and hang out and watch movies with my loving boyfriend
              who puts up with my long hours spent behind a computer screen. I
              am excited to work on projects and learn new things to grow my
              experience as a future developer in the field.

              My name is Samuel Kraus. I'm a one day-to-be full stack web
              developer in training! Though I'm a German American dual national,
              I'm currently living in Southeast Texas. They say everything is
              bigger in Texas and I hope our work here reflects that! I'm
              currently learning in Lambda School, starting from having
              absolutely no knowledge. I work full-time, raise 2 cats, and
              attempt to enjoy a bit of Warcraft in my downtime. (Lok'Tar!) I'm
              excited to keep creating amazing projects and look forward to
              seeing everyone in the future as a knowledgable developer!
